Revitron is a [Revit API](https://www.revitapidocs.com/) wrapper written in Python. It helps you to develop clean and powerful Revit plugins for [pyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit).

## Docs

An installation guide, the API reference and the UI docs can be found [here](https://revitron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).     

## Unit Tests

Revitron unit tests need their own pyRevit UI to run. Since they are only needed to develop the library extension and would only bother normal users, all unit tests are located in a [separate repository](https://github.com/revitron/revitron-tests) and can be installed as an independent UI extension if required.
